Sumobot Tournament System

This is a ruby on rails system, that may or may not be used.  This is just
some code used to experiment with rails with the goal of having a system you
can register with as a contender and sign up your bots to compete.  During
the event it would show a bracketing system as well as scores, etc.

Well that's the goal anyhow.  We'll see how far we get

Installation Instructions
---------------------------
Get rails, etc.  This project is rails 3.0 so read instructions on that.
Example for Ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RubyOnRails
You may want to install RVM if you want multiple version so rails installed

Change into the SumoTourney directory and type:

bundle update

(Note: you will need libmysqlclient-dev to build mysql2)

Copy config/database.yml-example to config/database.yml

Edit the file and create an account in your SQL server that matches.  You can
use sqlite3 for testing as well.  Once you have the datbase setup (with the yml
file) then you need to initialize it

rake db:migrate   (or rake db:migrate:reset if you munge the db)

Then start the server

rails server

You should be able to access it via localhost:3000
